## Tagless-redux

This project is a macro to generate `autoFunctorK` instances.  Also `finalAlg` is also provided.

`autoFunctorK` which you can read about [here](https://github.com/typelevel/cats-tagless).  Speaking
of that, this is basically a straight copy from the cats-tagless project, but done in reflect macros.

Reflect macros will most likely live through the 2.x series, scalameta macros are dead.

So thank you [Kailuo Wang](http://kailuowang.com)
